## Virtual Memory - Mark Prudnikov


#### How to run?
``gradle run`` in terminal. Be aware, you need to write pathes to files from console after the 
message, for example:
```
Input the path to file: ./data/test1  ./data/test2
```
Be careful, between each file there should be one space.

#### How to run Unit tests?
``gradle test`` in terminal.

#### How to run Integration tests?
``gradle integTest`` in terminal.
UPD: doesn't work. Open file ``src/integTest/IntegTest.kt`` and click to run button for the particular test function.

#### Result
See the result in ``./data/output.txt`` file.
